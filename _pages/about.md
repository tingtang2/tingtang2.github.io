Hi! My name is Ting Chen and I recently completed my Master's degree at Columbia University, studying Computer Science. I'm broadly interested in Bayesian statistics and neural network training dynamics as well as applications in the life sciences. I previously worked on argument mining within the field of natural language processing and am currently a machine learning engineer.
