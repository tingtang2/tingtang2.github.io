Hi! My name is Ting and I'm a first-year PhD student in the Columbia Statistics department. I'm broadly interested in Bayesian statistics and optimizing neural networks, as well as applications in the life sciences. I previously worked on argument mining within the field of natural language processing and was a machine learning engineer working on recommendation systems.
